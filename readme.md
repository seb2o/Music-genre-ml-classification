Music genre classification via machine learning

TODO : 
- add details to run the code for the TAs
- in the report.md, implement the algorithm for feature selection
- maybe use decision tree from last semester course for task 4/ random forest library if allowed, deep learning wont be great
- extract the code in the notebooks for tasks and put it in individual python files
