# Report Summary


### Task 1: Design a k-NN classifier (k =5) for all ten genres. Evaluate the performance of the classification model
#### features : ["spectral_rolloff_mean", "mfcc_1_mean", "spectral_centroid_mean", "tempo", "Genre"] 
Do we have to implement the kmeans algo ourselves ? 

### Task 2: Compare the feature distribution for the four classes; pop, disco, metal and classical. Analyze how the feature distribution relates to the performance of your classifier 

feat 1 and 3 are very similar; feat 2 is also kinda related. compute covariance to put numbers on this 

### Task 3 : Same classifier but only 3 of the features above and an arbitrary additional; motivate the choice.

### Task 4: Free classifier.
